[para]
This package provides script level access to the DNSSD library.
DNSSD allows registration of network services so that they
can easily be located by name and/or browsed for by service type.
On Apple platforms, this interaction is done via bonjour. On linux
environments, this interaction is done via avahi.

[para]
The DNSSD package currently supports browsing for services
and service name resolution.  Support for service registration is
planned in an upcoming version.

[para]
The dsnsd package provides the following commands:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd {::dnssd::browse start}] [arg regtype] [arg callback]]
This procedure begins a browse operation for a given service type.
Evey time a service is added or removed to the list of running services,
[arg callback] will be executed.
[nl]
[arg regtype] - The service type to browse (i.e., _http._tcp)
[nl]
[arg callback] - The command to call when a service is added or
removed from the list of running services.  Three arguments will
be appended to the command: the action (either "add" or "remove"),
the service name, and the domain.

[call [cmd {::dnssd::browse stop}] [arg regtype]]
This procedure stops a browse operation.  The callback registered
for [arg regtype] will no longer be called and no new services will
be added.
[nl]
[arg regtype] - The service type (i.e., _http._tcp)

[call [cmd ::dnssd::resolve] [arg name] [arg regtype] [arg domain] [arg script]]
This procedure resolves the given service name into a hostname and port.
[nl]
[arg name] - The name of the service to resolve
[nl]
[arg regtype] - The service type (i.e., _http._tcp)
[nl]
[arg domain] - The domain for the service, as returned by the browse
callback
[nl]
[arg script] - The script to execute when the resolution has completed.
Four arguments will be appended to the callback script:  The full
service name, the hostname, the port, and a list of txt records for
the service.  The list of records will be of the form {key value 
?key value? ...}.

[call [cmd ::dnssd::resolve_address] [arg name]]
This procedure resolves the given service name into an IP address.
[nl]
[arg name] The name of the service to resolve
[nl]
[arg script] - The script to execute when the resolution has completed.
The IP address of the service will be appended to the callback.

[call [cmd ::dnssd::register] [arg ?options?] [arg regtype] [arg port] [arg ?txt-record?]]
This procedure registers a new service using DNS-SD.
[nl]
[arg options] - Either -name, followed by the desired service name, or -- to explicitly
indicate the end of options.
[nl]
[arg regtype] - The service type (i.e., _http._tcp)
[nl]
[arg port] - The port number for the service
